# Generative AI Project

This project introduces **Generative Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on building models that can generate and transform text using deep learning techniques. It explores the use of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models for handling sequential data. The project includes basic implementations of **text generation** and **text translation** using sequence-to-sequence approaches in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The main goal is to understand how generative models learn patterns from data and apply them to real-world language tasks.
